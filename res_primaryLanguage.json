      "description": "I am a computer scientist with a passion for artificial intelligence. I am actively improving my skills through online resources, as well as developing my own projects. My research is centered around AI, and for my bachelor thesis, I studied and illustrated its potential in real-world scenarios. Later on, I expanded my knowledge by diving into deep learning. I have applied these techniques to my own projects, as well as those offered on the Kaggle platform.",
